I’m a passionate engineering student exploring the world of programming and development. I enjoy working with Python, building beginner-friendly applications like automation tools, reminder systems, and small web projects. I also have a growing interest in HTML, CSS, and front-end development, and I’m gradually learning how to integrate my coding skills into user-friendly interfaces.
